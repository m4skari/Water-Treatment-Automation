# Water Treatment Plant Automation

## Description
This project simulates an **Industrial Water Treatment Plant** using Siemens PLC (S7-300) and WinCC HMI in TIA Portal. The simulation involves multiple stages like filtration, aeration, chlorination, and temperature control.
This project was the final project of the Industrial Automation course at the University of Tehran, taught by Dr. Touraj Abbasian.

## Technologies Used
- Siemens TIA Portal V16
- S7-300 PLC
- WinCC HMI
- S7-PLCSIM

## Process Stages
1. Screening
2. Aeration Basin
3. Gravity Filter
4. Chlorination
5. Heating & Distribution

## How to Run
1. Open the **TIA Portal Project**.
2. Load the simulation with **PLCSIM**.
3. Open the HMI in WinCC Runtime.
4. Press **START** button on HMI to run the process.
